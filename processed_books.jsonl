[Which was the Virgina Provincial\nConvention, March 23, 1775]", "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775. No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony. The questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings. Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part\nof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?\nAre we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,\nand, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their\ntemporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,\nI am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.", "Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.

I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir, she has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free-- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us! They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week, or the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir, we have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come. It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--\nbut there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps\nfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!\nOur brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?\nWhat is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,\nor peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\nForbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take;\nbut as for me, give me liberty or give me death!", "It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--\nbut there is no peace.

And the war came.", "One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\nthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\ninsurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed\nno right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.", "Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\nwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\nshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\nfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray\nto the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.\nIt may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's\nassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces;\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged.

Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\" With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\nto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds;\nto care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\nand his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\nand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.", "With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\nto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds;\nto care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\nand his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\nand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.", "December, 1979  [Etext #9] Lincoln's First Inaugural Address\nMarch 4, 1861 Fellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old\nas the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\nand to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\nof the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters\non the execution of his office.\"", "Fellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old\nas the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\nand to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\nof the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters\non the execution of his office.\"", "I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters\nof administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.", "Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection.  It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\" Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: \"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\nof the rights of the States, and especially\nthe right of each State to order and control\nits own domestic institutions according to\nits own judgment exclusively, is essential\nto that balance of power on which the perfection\nand endurance of our political fabric depend,\nand we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory,\nno matter under what pretext,\nas among the gravest of crimes.\"", "\"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\nof the rights of the States, and especially\nthe right of each State to order and control\nits own domestic institutions according to\nits own judgment exclusively, is essential\nto that balance of power on which the perfection\nand endurance of our political fabric depend,\nand we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory,\nno matter under what pretext,\nas among the gravest of crimes.\"", "I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\nis susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\nare to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\nI add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\nConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\nto all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--\nas cheerfully to one section as to another.", "There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\nfrom service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\nwritten in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:", "\"No person held to service or labor in one State,\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another,\nshall in consequence of any law or regulation\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor,\nbut shall be delivered up on claim of the party\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\"", "It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\nwho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\nand the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\nof Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--\nto this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\nthen, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\n\"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\nwould make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\nequal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\nthat unanimous oath?", "There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\nbe enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\ndifference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\nsurrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\nby which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\ncontent that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\ncontroversy as to HOW it shall be kept?", "Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\nso that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\nAnd might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\nenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\n\"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged and\nimmunities of citizens in the several States?\"", "I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\nand with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\nany hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\nparticular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\nthat it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\nto conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\nthan to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\nthem held to be unConstitutional.", "It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\nunder our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\nthe executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\nmany perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\nof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.", "I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\nthe Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\nif not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\nIt is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\nin its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\nthe express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\nendure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\nnot provided for in the instrument itself.", "Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\nof States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\nbe peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;\nbut does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?", "Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition\nthat in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\nthe history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\nthe Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\nAssociation in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\nand the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\nand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\nin 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\nand establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\"", "But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\nbe lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\nhaving lost the vital element of perpetuity.", "It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\nto that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\nwithin any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\nare insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.", "I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\nthe Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\nas the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\nlaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\nDoing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\nand I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\nrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\nrequisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\nI trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\ndefend and maintain itself.", "In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices. The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\nof the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\nand reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\na hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\nrestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.", "The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\nof the Union.

To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?", "Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?\nWill you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\nthat any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\nWill you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\nthe real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so\nfearful a mistake?", "All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights can be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such a right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not expressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\nThere is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\nacquiescence on one side or the other.", "From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\nThere is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\nacquiescence on one side or the other.", "If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,\nthey make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;\nfor a minority of their own will secede from them whenever\na majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.\nFor instance, why may not any portion of a new\nconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\nprecisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?\nAll who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the\nexact temper of doing this.", "Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States\nto compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,\nand prevent renewed secession?", "Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\nA majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\nand always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular\nopinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\nWhoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,\nis wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,\nanarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.", "I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought not to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases AFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived, without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right to dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,\nand they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the\nseparation of the states.  The people themselves can do this\nalso if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to\ndo with it.

Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action.

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. --Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.
